## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher at ETH Zurich, and have been studying on **digital human technologies**. My researches cover human body/motion modeling, behavior generation, embodied AI, generative models, 3D body shape and pose estimation, etc, as well as their applications in mixed reality, architecture design, human-centric simulation, and healthcare. 



<!-- ## Research Experiences and Interests

- **Computer Vision:** body pose estimation, action understanding, motion and correspondence problem
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models, reinforcement learning, inverse problem
- **Graphics:** motion capture and behavior synthesis, human-scene interactions, parametric body models, neural rendering
- **Applications:** mixed reality, synthetic data, human-centric simulation, embodied AI, etc. -->
