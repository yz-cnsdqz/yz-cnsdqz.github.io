## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher at ETH Zurich, and have been studying on **digital human technologies**. My researches cover human body/motion modeling, behavior generation and understanding, generative models, body pose estimation and motion capture, etc, as well as their applications in mixed reality, architecture design, and healthcare. 

## Research Experiences and Interests

- **Computer Vision:** body pose estimation, behavior understanding, motion and correspondence problem
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative modeling, reinforcement learning, inverse problem
- **Graphics:** motion capture and behavior synthesis, human-scene interactions, parametric body models, neural rendering
- **Applications:** mixed reality, synthetic data, human-centric simulation, healthcare, etc.


## News
- **[Jul. 2023]** Two papers, [DIMOS](https://zkf1997.github.io/DIMOS/) and [EgoHMR](https://sanweiliti.github.io/egohmr/egohmr.html), are accepted to ICCV'23.
- **[Jun. 2023]** Serve as area chair for 3DV'24, and reviewer for Siggraph Asia'23.
