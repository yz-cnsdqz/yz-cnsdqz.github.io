## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher at ETH Zurich, and have been studying on digital human technologies. My researches cover human body/motion modeling, behavior understanding and synthesis, body pose estimation and motion capture, etc, as well as their applications in mixed reality, architecture design, and healthcare. 

## Research Experiences and Interests

- **Computer Vision:** body pose estimation, behavior understanding, motion and correspondence problem
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative modeling, reinforcement learning, inverse problem
- **Graphics:** motion capture and behavior synthesis, human-scene interactions, parametric body models, neural rendering

## News

- **[Jun. 2023]** Serve as area chair for 3DV'24, and reviewer for Siggraph Asia'23.
