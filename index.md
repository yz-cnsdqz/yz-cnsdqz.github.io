## About Me
I am a research scientist at [Meshcapade](https://meshcapade.com/), working on **human foundation models**. 
My research covers human motion and behavior synthesis, 3D human perception, generative foundation models, and their applications in AR/VR, embodied AI, interactive avatar, and beyond.

**Short Bio**
