## About Me
I am currently a machine learning scientist at [Meshcapade](https://meshcapade.com/). Before I was a postdoc researcher at ETH Zurich. 
My researches cover a wide range of topics on **human-centric AI**, in particularly on human motion and behavior modeling, 3D shape and pose estimation, generative models, etc., as well as their applications in mixed reality, architecture design, human-centric simulation, and healthcare. 


<!-- ## Research Experiences and Interests

- **Computer Vision:** body pose estimation, action understanding, motion and correspondence problem
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models, reinforcement learning, inverse problem
- **Graphics:** motion capture and behavior synthesis, human-scene interactions, parametric body models, neural rendering
- **Applications:** mixed reality, synthetic data, human-centric simulation, embodied AI, etc. -->
