## About Me
I am currently a machine learning scientist at [Meshcapade](https://meshcapade.com/), working on **human foundation models and behavior computing**. 
My researches have been covering human motion and behavior modeling, 3D human perception, generative models, etc., as well as their applications in mixed reality, embodied AI, architecture design, and others. 

During 2020-2023, I was a postdoc researcher at [VLG, ETH Zurich](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch), supervised by Prof. Siyu Tang. 
I got my PhD degree at June 2020 from Ulm University, Germany, supervised by Prof. Heiko Neumann. 
During 2018-2020, I was a research intern at Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, working with Prof. Siyu Tang, Prof. Michael J. Black, and other PS folks.
Please see more details in my [CV](assets/files/yanzhang_CV.pdf).
